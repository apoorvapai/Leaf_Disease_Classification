# 🌿 Jasmine Leaf Classification using CNN 

This project focuses on classifying jasmine leaves into three categories:
- 🍃 **Healthy**
- 🌱 **Beginning Stage**
- 🍂 **Final Stage**

Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), this model achieves an impressive accuracy of **97%** in detecting the health status of jasmine leaves.
